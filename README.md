# Vending Machine with State Design Pattern

## Introduction to State Design Pattern

The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It enables an object to change its class when its state changes, which is particularly useful for managing complex state-based behaviors. In the context of this project, we utilize the State Design Pattern to efficiently handle various vending machine states, such as selecting items, processing payments, and dispensing products.

Key concepts of the State Design Pattern:

- **State:** Represents a specific state of an object and defines the behaviors associated with that state.

- **Context:** Maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific operations to the state objects.

- **Concrete State:** Implements the behaviors associated with a particular state and transitions between states as required.

## Design

This project leverages the State Design Pattern to effectively manage different vending machine states. Each state, such as selecting items, processing payments, and dispensing products, is encapsulated within separate classes. This approach promotes code clarity, making it easier to understand and extend.

## Implementation

The project includes C# code files that serve as practical examples of the State Design Pattern. It comprises the main vending machine class, state interfaces, and example state classes, demonstrating how to implement the pattern effectively.
